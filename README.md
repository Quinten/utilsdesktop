# utilsdesktop

utilsdesktop has 2 very simple tools written in javascript.

One tool is for making rgb hex web colors with either range sliders or a text field.

The other one is a magic math input field. You type some math inside the input field and then hit enter to see the result. Try it by typing '1 + 1' and hitting enter.
